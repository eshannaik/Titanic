#### This project was done on Google Colab.
#### The dataset for this project can be got from https://www.kaggle.com/heptapod/titanic.

________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
#### The main objective of this project is to predict if a person will survive during the titanic incident. 
#### The different models that have been used to try to predict this are -
    ANN
    SVM
    Logistic Regressing using GridSearchCV
    Random Forest

#### The different libraries that have been used are :
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Sklearn
    Keras
    
#### The accuracies achieved for the different models are :
    ANN : 74.55 %
    SVM : 85.24 %
    Logistic Regression : 84.08 %
    Random Forest : 85.24%
    
#### As we can see Light GBM has the highest accuracy which is 97.937%
