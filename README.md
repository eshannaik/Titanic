#### The main objective of this project is to predict if an sms is a spam or not. 
#### The different models that have been used to try to predict this are -
    ANN
    SVM
    Logistic Regressing using GridSearchCV

#### The different libraries that have been used are :
    Pandas
    Numpy
    Matplotlib
    Seaborn
    Sklearn
    Keras
    
#### The accuracies achieved for the different models are :
    ANN : 86.547 %
    SVM : 97.937 %
    Logistic Regression : 96.413 %
    
#### As we can see Light GBM has the highest accuracy which is 97.937%
